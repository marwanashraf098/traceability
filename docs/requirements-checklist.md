## FR-3 Shopify Integration (order source — always)

- [x] 4.7 [M] Status sync: webhook (secret header, verify-by-fetch, no HMAC exists) + 15–30 min polling; (state, type)-keyed mapping; numberOfAttempts stored; trackingNumber as string; unknown codes → exception+alert [Day 6 — webhook→ledger wiring complete; polling not yet built]
